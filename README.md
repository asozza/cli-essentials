Command-Line Interface for Unix-like systems

At the moment, it covers the following tasks:

- [ ] `bash`: basic commands, ghostscript, media (audio, video), scripts for killing processes
- [ ] `config`: configuration files and dot files
- [ ] `ffmpeg`: audio and video manipulation
- [ ] `git`: basic commands, check status in multiple repositories
- [ ] `gs`: ghostscript command for PDF manipulation
- [ ] `gnuplot`: general commands and palettes
- [ ] `tikz`: some sketches for figures and for project management

In the process of extending the materials, 
each folder should contains folders: `scripts` and `documentation`,
in order to separate markdown and executable scripts.
